I"ä<p>Well with ksp 1.8 deltaV Requirements and being a beginner science can be your first save then carrer then sandbox
kerbal engineer redux is a must install for ksp here it is <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods/kerbal-engineer-redux/download"> Kerbal Engineer Redux </a>
its good for beginners and also good for youtubers and even when your advanced you want to show your a genius and
every thing goes right first time or give it all at once to fail in front of your viewers that you may like so they
know everything never always goes right first time like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/krampfbein"> Shadow Zone </a>
do it however you want just please do a science mode playthrough before trying anything else</p>

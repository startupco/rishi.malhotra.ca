<span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>HAPPY FATHERS DAY AJAY!</strong></span> I love you so much. You are such a
good dad, you help me in everything <strong>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH</strong><br><br>
Dad, you make such tasty pancakes, and burgers, and fries for our family!<br>
So glad we all share such fun times together, Daddy.<br>
We deeply admire the good man and wonderful father you are."<br><br>
I’m so proud to be your son.
Dad, you’re still the one I think of first when I have a question about something or when I just need some support and good advice. Thank you for always being there for me.
You taught me so many of the important things I know including a few choice words for certain situations.
Thank you for being there every day with just the love and guidance I’ve needed.
You’re my one and only dad, and I’ll always have a special place in my heart for you.
God gave me such a good gift when he gave me you for a father.
Thank you for everything you do for me.

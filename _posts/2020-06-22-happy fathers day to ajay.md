<span style="font-size:20px;"><strong>HAPPY FATHERS DAY AJAY</strong></span>I love you so much you are such a
good dad you help in everything <strong>I LOVE YOU SO MUCH</strong>
for everyone: "We could never hide how much we love you, Dad. Not even in a duck blind with camo on!
With you, Dad, Father’s Day means lots of tasty grilled things and lots for our family to celebrate!
So glad we all share such fun times together, Daddy.
We deeply admire the good man and wonderful father you are."
for dad: "I’m so proud to be your son.
Dad, you’re in all my favorite memories.
Dad, you’re still the one I think of first when I have a question about something or when I just need some support and good advice. Thank you for always being there for me.
Happy Father’s Day to the man who put the fear into all my homecoming and prom dates…and who still treats me like a princess!
You taught me so many of the important things I know—including a few choice words for certain situations.
Thank you for being there every day with just the love and guidance I’ve needed.
You’re my one and only dad, and I’ll always have a special place in my heart for you.
God gave me such a good gift when he gave me you for a father.
You made growing up fun."
